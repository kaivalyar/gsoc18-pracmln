<p>Upon further analysis of the profiles, I identified a few areas of PracMLN to focus on. This analysis and the resultant edits further sped up the code by ~15%. After much deliberation; the locations of interest were identified to be:</p>

<ul>
<li>the <code>_iterworlds</code> function</li>
<li>general speedups across <code>fol.pyx</code> and <code>fuzzy.pyx</code></li>
<li>multiple <code>truth</code> functions in <code>common.pyx</code></li>
</ul>

<h1 id="a-setback">A Setback</h1>

<p>So my first approach was to quickly type all the relevant variables, and commit my changes. I had been working on PracMLN for a few months now, and I got a little overconfident with my capabilities. While the code was still compiling, running it gave arcane errors.</p>

<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &quot;test.py&quot;, line 119, in &lt;module&gt;
    main()
  File &quot;test.py&quot;, line 116, in main
    runall()
  File &quot;test.py&quot;, line 96, in runall
    test_inference_smokers()
  File &quot;test.py&quot;, line 22, in test_inference_smokers
    mln = MLN(mlnfile=pth, grammar='StandardGrammar')
  File &quot;base.pyx&quot;, line 97, in pracmln.mln.base.MLN.__init__
  File &quot;base.pyx&quot;, line 557, in pracmln.mln.base.MLN.load
  File &quot;base.pyx&quot;, line 742, in pracmln.mln.base.parse_mln
  File &quot;base.pyx&quot;, line 192, in pracmln.mln.base.MLN.predicate
  File &quot;base.pyx&quot;, line 224, in pracmln.mln.base.MLN.declare_predicate
AttributeError: 'pracmln.mln.mlnpreds.Predicate' object has no attribute 'name'
</code></pre>

<p>On the surface, this is an attribute error with a trivial fix. However, fixing it will only lead to another error &hellip;</p>

<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &quot;test.py&quot;, line 8, in &lt;module&gt;
    from pracmln import MLN, Database
  File &quot;/home/kaivalya/ ... /python3/pracmln/__init__.py&quot;, line 22, in &lt;module&gt;
    from .mln.base import MLN
  File &quot;/home/kaivalya/ ... /python3/pracmln/mln/__init__.py&quot;, line 27, in &lt;module&gt;
    from .base import MLN
  File &quot;base.pyx&quot;, line 32, in init pracmln.mln.base
  File &quot;mlnpreds.pxd&quot;, line 1, in init pracmln.mln.mrf
  File &quot;mlnpreds.pyx&quot;, line 25, in init pracmln.mln.mlnpreds
ImportError: cannot import name BinaryVariable
</code></pre>

<p>&hellip; and so, on and on it went. I was nowhere near completing my planned optimisations, and I didn&rsquo;t even know how far I was from finishing them. Moreover, it was not possible to leave the <code>gsoc18-cython</code> branch in this state, as the code, far from running with speed and efficiency, wasn&rsquo;t even running with correcness.</p>

<h1 id="branching">Branching</h1>

<p>More drastic measures were required. At this point, I decided to undo al my commits from the week <strong>(thank Linus Torvalds for Git version control)</strong>. I created three separate branches, and splite my work across them. Special care had to be taken, when checking out between various branches, to recompile the code, and delete/recreate symlinks to the appropriate files.</p>

<p>I have now merged these branches into my main <code>gsoc18-cython</code> branch, and the resultant changes, together yield a further ~15% speedup.</p>

<h1 id="iterworlds">iterworlds</h1>

<p>To properly Cythonise and speedup <code>iterworlds</code> (from <code>mrf.pyx</code>), some other changes needed to be made too. Namely, <code>util.py</code> and <code>mrfvars.py</code> were converted into <code>util.pyx</code> and <code>mrfvars.pyx</code> respectively. This was done so that <code>CallByRef()</code> and <code>MRFVariable()</code> could be made into extension types. In fact, not doing this was responsible for causing many of the errors previously encountered.</p>

<p>Cythonising <code>_iterworlds( ...  )</code> was then trivial, and accomplished without major complications worth documenting.</p>

<h1 id="truth">truth</h1>

<p>The various <code>truth</code> functions in logic module all accept a <code>world</code> parameter, representing (initially) the <code>evidence</code> presented to the Markov Logic Network. They then evaluate the truth or falsity of the particular <code>Formula</code>. While I successfully converted all of these to cython, there remain singificant unresolved issues.</p>

<p>The first thing to note is that there are many of them. In the case of <code>Enumeration-Ask</code>, with the smokers and taxonomy tests I was running, particular ones may be more usd than other, but this doesn&rsquo;t generalise further - varying from problem to problem. Here are the all truth functions from <code>common.pyx</code>.</p>


<figure>
    
        <img src="/gsoc18-pracmln/media/truth.png" />
    
    
    <figcaption>
        <h4>Truth Functions in the Logic Module</h4>
        
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>


<p>Another noteworthy thing is that many of these functions are trivial. They often have single statements:</p>

<pre><code>def truth(self, world):
    raise Exception(&quot;%s does not implement truth&quot; % str(type(self)))
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>def truth(self, world):
    return None
</code></pre>

<p>Not much optimisation possible here*!</p>

<p>The funtions marked red in the figure above are the ones that are actually possible to optimise. Bold text is used to indicate significant changes.</p>

<p>Finally, the functions are all typed as <code>cpdef</code>. Unitl the cythonisation of PracMLN is complete, this needs to remain, since the functions are often called by python code. Performace can however be greatly improved if the functions can all by redifined with <code>cdef</code>.</p>

<p>*: This is technically untrue. If the functions could be typed as <code>cdef</code>, then they coud make use of C <code>inline</code> functionality, essentially making them as fast as macros. This would provide a tremendous speed gain, but would be possible only once all calling code is Cythonised.</p>

<h1 id="fol-pyx-and-fuzzy-pyx">fol.pyx and fuzzy.pyx</h1>

<p>The primary objective here was to speedup the entire logic module - including code beyond <code>common.pyx</code>. If you recall from one of my <a href="../the-logic-module/">previous posts</a>, converting <code>FirstOrderLogic</code> and <code>FuzzyLogic</code> to extension types is not possible. This was because the inner classes defined here made use of Python multiple inheritance - not permitted in Cython at all.</p>

<p>Daniel helped me overcome this problem - I redefined the class hierarchies entirely, getting rid of the multiple inheritance. It turns out, the second parent of the classes was redundant anyway, as it was already an ancestor. Consider the following example, with multiple inheritance, for <code>Disjunction</code>.</p>


<figure>
    
        <img src="/gsoc18-pracmln/media/OldFOL.png" />
    
    
    <figcaption>
        <h4>Old Inheritance Diagram for FOL Disjunction</h4>
        
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>


<p>This can be refactored, without losing functionality, in the following manner.</p>


<figure>
    
        <img src="/gsoc18-pracmln/media/NewFOL.png" />
    
    
    <figcaption>
        <h4>New Inheritance Diagram for FOL Disjunction</h4>
        
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>


<p>Once this refactoring was done, the inner classes were moved outside, just like in <code>common.pyx</code>, and <code>FirstOrderLogic</code> and <code>FuzzyLogic</code> were promptly converted to extension types.</p>

<h1 id="merging-and-testing">Merging and Testing</h1>

<p>With work on these branches complete, each was tested in isolation, and any remaining bugs were resolved. The branches were then all merged into the <code>gsoc18-cython</code> branch, and the code was profiled once again. Another speedup of ~15% was found. Thus the total speed gains stand at ~25%.</p>

<p>It is worth noting the inherent inaccuracy of these timing estimates here. Runtime fluctuates widely (atleast on my machine), and it is extremely difficult to control for background processes and other tasks when runnning such a significant, time-sensitive test. This problem can be mitigated by measuring runtime multiple times, and comparing averages, however this is an extremely slow process, since each pair of runs can take more than 15 minutes at a time.</p>

<p>The good news is that, despite all this, a very significant speedup has been achieved. Moreover, this speedup (while tested only for <code>Enumeration-Ask</code>) should hold for all PracMLN algorithms. The majority of the edits made over the course of this project were made to the common areas of the code - affecting all learning and inference algorithms.</p>
